  <h2>Approach</h2>
  <p>
    I focus on understanding how systems are used in practice before making changes, with attention to maintainability, clarity, and user impact. My exposure to both development and IT support contexts has shaped a practical approach to building and improving systems.
  </p>
  <p>
    I incorporate accessibility and documentation considerations into projects to support long-term use and maintenance. This includes semantic HTML, keyboard navigation, proper error handling, and clear documentation.
