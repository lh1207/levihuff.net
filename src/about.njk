  <h2>Approach</h2>
  <p>
    I focus on understanding how systems are used in practice before making changes, with attention to maintainability, clarity, and user impact. My exposure to both development and IT support contexts has shaped a practical approach to building and improving systems.
  </p>
  <p>
    I incorporate accessibility and documentation considerations into projects to support long-term use and maintenance. This includes semantic HTML, keyboard navigation, proper error handling, and clear documentation.
  </p>

<section class="page-section">
  <h2>Projects and Contributions</h2>
  <p>
    I've built and maintained internal and academic projects that solve real problems, like ticketing systems, data handling applications, and workflow tracking tools. These projects show how I apply full stack development concepts to solve practical problems.

    <h3>Music - Trombone</h3>
    <p>
      I play trombone and was a member of the <strong>University of Cincinnati Bearcat Marching Band</strong> from 2020 to 2024. During my time with the band, I participated in numerous memorable events:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Goodyear Cotton Bowl Classic 2021</strong> - Performed at AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas</li>
      <li><strong>DCI (Drum Corps International) Celebration Tour 2021</strong> - Part of the special celebration events</li>

      Being part of the Bearcat Marching Band was an incredible experience that taught me discipline, teamwork, and the value of being part of something larger than myself. I also performed with Concert Band and Pep Band during my university years.
